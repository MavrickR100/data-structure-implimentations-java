# data-structure-implementations-java

This repository contains **Java implementations of core data structures**
written from scratch to understand their internal working without using
the Java Collections Framework.

Each data structure is implemented as a **separate Maven module**
with clean package structure and testability in mind.

---

## 📂 Current Implementations

- **Linked List**
    - Singly Linked List
    - Basic operations: insert, delete, traversal

> More data structures will be added incrementally.
