# data-structure-implementations-java

This repository contains **Java implementations of core data structures**
built from scratch to understand their internal working, memory handling,
and pointer manipulation — without using the Java Collections Framework.

Each data structure is implemented as a **separate Maven module**
with clean package separation.
