# data-structure-implementations-java

This repository contains **Java implementations of core data structures**
built from scratch to understand their internal working, memory handling,
and pointer manipulation — without using the Java Collections Framework.

Each data structure is implemented as a **separate Maven module**
with clean package separation.

---

## 📂 Implemented Data Structures

- **Singly Linked List**
  - Insert at beginning and end
  - Delete by value
  - Traversal

- **Doubly Linked List**
  - Insert at front and back
  - Delete from front and back
  - Forward traversal using head and tail pointers
